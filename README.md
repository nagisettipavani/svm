# SVM 

This code reads a dataset i.e, "Heart.csv". Preprocessing of dataset is done and we divide the dataset into training and testing datasets. Linear, rbf and Polynomial kernel SVC are applied and accuracy scores are calculated on the test data. Also, a graph is plotted to show change of accuracy with change in "C" value.
